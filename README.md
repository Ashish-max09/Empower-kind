# Empower-kind
Our project, EmpowerKind, was developed in collaboration with Matru Sewa Sangh (MSS), Nagpur, to support specially-abled children.
We identified the need for a centralized, secure donation platform where individuals and organizations can easily contribute funds, essential items, or services.

To address this, we designed and built a web-based platform using React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, featuring secure payment integration, NGO profiles, real-time donation tracking, and a user-friendly interface.

The platform aims to:

Simplify the donation process

Increase community participation

Ensure transparency and trust between donors and MSS

Through this project, we combined technical skills and social responsibility to create a solution that empowers specially-abled children and strengthens NGO support systems.
